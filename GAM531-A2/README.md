# GAM531-A2

1. Creates two vectors -> compute dot, cross, normalize.
2. Creates a matrix -> apply scaling, rotation, translation to a point.
3. Creates a quaternion -> applys rotation to a vector

The Library Used was OpenTK. (OpenTK.Mathematics - allows use of Vector3, Vector4, Matrix4, Quaternion, MathHelper) 
The project implements vector, matrix, and quaternion operations in C#.
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Dot Product
- Cross Product
- Scaling 
- Rotation
- Multiplication
- Identity
